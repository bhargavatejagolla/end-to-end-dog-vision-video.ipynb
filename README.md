## 📌 Project Overview

**End-to-End Dog Vision** is a deep learning computer vision project that classifies dog breeds using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Transfer Learning**.

The system takes an image of a dog as input and predicts its **breed with high accuracy**, demonstrating real-world applications of AI in image recognition.

This project follows a complete **machine learning lifecycle** — from data preprocessing to training, evaluation, and prediction.
